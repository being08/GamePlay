# Problem Statement

Companies such as Riot Games and Epic Games have disrupted the industry by offering games for free, and first-person shooter and online battle-arena games have grown exponentially popular as a result. Alongside those free games, “skins” — typically visual enhancements, outfits or weapons that can personalize gaming avatars — have also become more popular, and users commonly pay a premium for these types of customizations. This is one reason why gaming company Roblox has become so successful; its platform allows so many ways for users to customize and style their identities in-game. &#x20;

There are other gaming applications for NFTs, too. Take Warcraft or Minecraft: Both games allow users to create their own gaming world or map, and they provide endless tools to help gamers leverage their creativity and build elaborate, unique worlds. But what if gamers could sell their proprietary map or world — and their authorship or rights to it — to someone else? NFTs could help make this possible.

GamePlay aims to solve this problem by providing a decentralized platform to user as a Gaming NFT and many benefits of decentralized gameplay include:

·      **Ownership:** Traditional in-game purchases are one-time, non-transferrable investments that remain locked in a single gaming world. In contrast, using NFTs in gaming environments grants players ownership of their in-game assets instead of game developers. Through blockchain technology, gamers can save in-game purchases, sell them to other players, or move them into other supported games.

·      **Provable Scarcity:** Collectors value rarity and authenticity, and the scarcity of in-game NFT purchases is provable through the immutable records embedded in an NFT’s underlying blockchain network. This distributed public ledger validates the number and uniqueness of each NFT as well as its ownership history.

·      **Interoperability**: Traditional online games exist on centralized servers. As such, in-game assets exist within proprietary systems that don't communicate with others. In contrast, decentralized games exist on independent blockchains that act as the backend framework for other interconnected games. As a result, game assets represented by NFTs can be designed to be interoperable across different environments.

·      **Immutability:** When a traditional online game shuts down, users traditionally lose all of their in-game purchases. NFTs, however, exist independently of a specific gaming platform and live on the blockchain itself. As such, in-game purchases can be bought and sold regardless of what happens to the game, and new games can be designed to plug into an existing blockchain protocol. Furthermore, blockchain-enabled game assets cannot be duplicated or tampered with because of the permanent record each NFT generates upon issuance.
